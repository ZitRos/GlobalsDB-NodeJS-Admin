GlobalsDB-NodeJS-Admin
======================

Easy visual interface for administrating GlobalsDB. Represents database in hierarchical tree-based view - one you haven't seen before.

Note that <b>modules/cache.node</b> may be corrupted because of git file encoding. If NodeJS will throw error about cache.node module, download the latest one from [official site](http://www.globalsdb.org/downloads) and replace your current.
